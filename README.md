# McHacks 2022 Project: Type Racer

## Inspiration
- Many of us know what type of racer is, but for us developers, it's not that useful. We spend most of our days writing code, and we don't have a fun tool to use in order to practice our coding speed. That is why we have created Code Runner, a platform where all developers will be able to practice their coding speed and experience in the language of their choice while enjoying their time!

### What's next for code runner
- We would like to add more code samples for each coding language. We would also like to complete the other sections of the topbar including the home page, and the achievements page, where users will be able to win prizes according to their progress on the website. It would also be great to improve the algorithm that determines the words written per minute and add an algorithm to stop the game when we reach the end of a displayed string. Finally, it would be nice to host this website and make it usable in multiplayer.
